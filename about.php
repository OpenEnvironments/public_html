<b>More of the back story</b>
<hr>
Until the early years of this century, companies pursued analytics with a familiar design: a large computer drove a large disk array, both of proprietary design.
Scaling up and out were both constrained by the innovation of the vendors involved.<br>
<br>
But the digital era has given us a confluence<ul>
<li>virtualized (cloud) computing,</li>
<li>commoditized hardware,</li>
<li>open sourced software,</li>
<li>many (many) more interactions to collect</li>
</ul><br>
<br>
These have unleashed both the data storage (Big Data) and subsequently the compute abilities needed (GPU, Spark, etc) to unleash computational mathematics in practice.<br>
Initially, the work was called Data Science generally, then Machine Learning and now the more advanced field of Artificial Intelligence.<br>
<br>
<br>
That is<br>
If you have some data<br>
and a few of the scarce analytical hands<br>
